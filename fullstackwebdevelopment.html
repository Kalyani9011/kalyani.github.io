        <h1>What is a Full Stack Developer?</h1>
        <p>A software engineer that is proficient in both front-end and back-end programming is 
            known as a full-stack developer. They have experience dealing with a variety of web development technologies,
             such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, databases, servers, APIs, and frameworks, among others.

            Let’s take the building of a Facebook-like social media platform as an example. 
            The front-end and back-end of the application would be built by a full-stack developer focusing on this project.</p>
        <p>In order to generate the platform’s visual elements, the developer would design the user interface on the front end using tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, 
            they would leverage front-end frameworks like React or Angular to speed up the development process.</p>
        <p>In order to manage the data and process requests, the developer would write the server-side code using tools
             like Node.js and PHP. To store user data and other data, they would also employ databases like MySQL or MongoDB.</p>
        <p>The integration of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for functions
             like authentication, messaging, and notifications would also fall within the purview of a complete stack developer.</p>
        <p>The full-stack developer may make sure that all parts are flawlessly 
            linked and work together as an integrated unit by working on both the front-end and back-end of the social media platform.
             Because of the wide breadth of technical knowledge and problem-solving skills required, full-stack developers are in high 
             demand in the software development sector. <hr>
