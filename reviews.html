    <p>
        Being from an IT background but still felt some missing pieces which TapAcademy has been filling.
        I have never felt such kind of experience anywhere. From explaining things in visual forms to bringing countless
         placement offers for us. And my basic is so strong now. College definitely has a curriculum and they have to
          follow it but here they are so focused on building our basics, personality and everything. Best experience honestly.
